Clean out old AStar code and remove old usages of it
Setup AStar to also work for graphs

Dec 4th 2024
look into GridWalker and see if needs doing
	Maybe hash the history?
Test GetNeighbour stuff in GridObject
Grid/line stuff:
get all points exact distance/ within distance away
do 3 GridLocations make a line?
	Do 3 points make a line in this order?
	Does this point fall on this non infinite line?
		Do this point fall between these two other points(even not on a line, say the outer points make a square. Are we in the square?)


Make GridHelper method to expand the grid?
Try and Remove GridHelper Weird Types

Write more unit tests.

Write methods to rotate grids around a point? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system#Rotation

maybe implement something for altering grids per iteration on an action?
build something to roll/fall items in a 2D/3D grid.

Write a line class with start and ends?
	Maybe something to count the points in it? Might already have in grid helper
	Could also do the form y = mx + b or y2 - y1 = m(x2-x1)
	Also a 3 point one https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_equation#More_than_two_variables

There's a bunch of path finding
	shortest path between all points
	DFS



Automation:
	Parse and grab example text
		maybe this is fine with my browser script?
	Submit via program running
		submit when example is correct?
	record submissions as json
	don't submit anything that's lower than a "too low" answer

Continue on CardObjectStuff
	Nah use this persons clever solution of counting hands?
