line/num parser shouldn't throw

maybe implement something for altering grids per iteration on an action?
Build something to count items in a grid

// maybe a Grid object I can return with things like width?

CreateNewDay should create any missing parts even if solution is there

Solutions should output time as well

Algorithms needed:
Chinese Remainder Theorem

Automation:
	Parse and grab example text
	Submit via program running
		submit when example is correct?
	record submissions as json
